Train the Classifier
The classifier learns from 28 days of SMP training data. Features are sleep hours, water glasses, and bench press weight. The label is whether steps reached 10,000 that day.

The model splits the data 80/20 for training and testing, then reports its accuracy on the held-out test set.
